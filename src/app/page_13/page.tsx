              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Cybersecurity firms thrive because every business needs protection. Side hustles can earn extra cash; startups can become full-time empires. Both tap into a growing market.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                It works because data breaches are costly, so companies pay for audits or systems. Earnings start at $500/client and scale to six figures monthly. Corporate clients fuel big profits.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                No-investment relies on learning skills and hustling. Invested uses cash for speed, like premium software or marketing. We'll explore both, with cybersecurity's high earning potential as the focus.
