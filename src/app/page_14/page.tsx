              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                A Data Insights business lets you turn numbers into actionable advice, earning while solving real problems. Side hustles provide quick extra income; startups can evolve into high-revenue consulting firms. Both leverage the booming data market.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                It works because most businesses lack the expertise to analyze their own data effectively. Earnings begin with $500–$2,000 projects and hit $5,000–$10,000/month for retainers. Tools like Google Analytics make entry easy, even for beginners.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                No-investment focuses on sweat equity – learning and hustling with basics. Invested paths use funds for advanced tools or faster client acquisition. We'll explore both, highlighting the business's potential for freelance and consulting income.
